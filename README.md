# Store Demand Forecasting by Suraj Kumar

Store demand forecasting is an essential task for retail businesses to predict the demand for various products. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to forecast store demand using historical sales data. By understanding the patterns in sales, businesses can optimize inventory management and improve their supply chain efficiency.

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

### Project Description
The project applies machine learning models to predict store demand based on historical data. It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced deep learning techniques to build a robust forecasting model.

### Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Building
3. Evaluation and Forecasting
